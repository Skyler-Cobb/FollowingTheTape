type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The flagship product of Feeder Tech, regularly advertised by Mr. Pickles. This brine is seemingly sold on its own, without any cucumbers, calling into question exactly what it is or why it would be purchased.

Some theories speculate that the brine is one of several ways that Mother Brain is being deliberately spread, or that it's a metaphor for trauma ("I don't like to call it trauma, it's just a bad memory" and "You've got a lot of brine... now you have to pay for it.").
