The final sequence for the code that I came to was:  
4.3.1..3...6..8.6...5..2..0.1.3...1.2..5.5.9.4.5..

This translates to: REACHINGSPQCQSTTORG

That said, it clearly isn't right, but strongly resembles the URL for the website we've already found, reachingspaces.org, so... it's probably the case that the code was actually:

4.3.1..3...6..8.6...5..2..0.1..3...3.2...9.4.5..  
Meaning "reachingspaces.org"

Or this:  
4.3.1..3...6..8.6...5..2..0.1..3...3.2..3..9.5.9.4.5..  
Meaning "reachingspacesdotorg"
