*Note: This video is a bit chaotic, with 3 different audio interactions happening often intermingled with one another: the conversation between Dee and the customer, the audio from the TV, and the conversation between Dee and Graves via phone/radio. For the sake of clarity, I've divided the transcript into 3 columns, with the left one being Dee in Person, the middle being TV, and the right being Dee/Graves.*

Transcript:

| In the Building | Audio from the TV | Dee and Graves (Remote) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |

| \[Dee\] Yep\! All good on that front... um...  but, um... I mean, I still have to go check, but it's not looking like we have your car... |  |  |
| \[Girl\] Uh.... |  |  |
| \[Dee\] Yeah, I'm not *really* sure what to do about that... |  |  |
| \[Girl\] How do you not have my car? |  |  |
| \[Dee\] This is honestly a first for us... |  |  |
| \[Girl\] Uh... well, who picked it up? Somebody took my car, man,- |  |  |
| \[Dee\] Right, yeah- |  |  |
| \[Girl\] I mean I gave you the ticket, It has your business name on it, fuckin Moe's Tows, |  |  |
| \[Dee\] I think, uh... |  |  |
| \[Girl\] Was it you? |  |  |
| \[Dee\] It looks like... |  |  |
| \[Girl\] How do you not have my car? |  |  |
| \[Dee\] Let me-let me check something real quick... |  |  |
|  |  | \[Dee\] Graves? |
|  |  | \[Graves\] Sup? |
|  |  | \[Dee\] Are you there yet? |
|  |  | \[Graves\] Dead in the middle. |
|  |  | \[Dee\] Never mind. |
| \[Girl\] What the fuck am I supposed to do?\! |  |  |
| \*Dog whines with increasing urgency\* |  |  |
| \[Dee\] *Cool it, lady\!* Not now\! |  |  |
| \[Girl\] Oh my god, I'm gonna have to call the fuckin cops. |  |  |
| \[Dee\] Oh n-no, yo-you don't have to- |  |  |
| \[Girl\] No, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. |  |  |
| \[Dee\] Wait- |  |  |
| \[Girl\] No, I'm leaving, get out of my way. |  |  |
| \*Girl starts dialing a number\* |  |  |
| \[Dee\] But it's the middle of the night\! Where are you going? Wait, are you calling them now? |  |  |
| \[Girl\] I'm calling myself a cab |  |  |
| \[Dee\] I-I can get you a cab\! I can get you a cab, free of charge\! |  |  |
| \[Girl\] No, I- you've done enough, alright? |  |  |
| \[Dee\] Just- wait, wait\! |  |  |
| \[Girl\] What?\! |  |  |
| \[Dee\] Please, wait\!  |  |  |
| \[Girl\] *What?\!* |  |  |
| \[Dee\] \*Sighs\* Will you just stay here and let me go check?  |  |  |
| \[Girl\] Check for my- my car? |  |  |
| \[Dee\] Just- give me a minute. |  |  |
| \[Girl\] Dude- |  |  |
| \[Dee\] 10 minutes. Let me go look over our yard, give it a look over, who knows? The system isn't perfect. |  |  |
| \[Girl\] Okay... \*phone beeps as if hanging up\* *fuck*, you have 5 minutes. |  |  |
| \[Dee\] (Presumably gesturing for ladybug to follow) Ladybug, here. |  |  |
| \*Ladybug continues whining as she has been the entire time\* |  |  |
| \[Dee\] Fine, stay put. |  |  |
| \*Ladybug's whining gets a bit more urgent. Sounds of a door opening and closing\* |  |  |
| *For a few moments, the sound of footsteps with ladybug whining.* |  |  |
| \[Girl\] Dude, fuck this. \*Dialing on phone again\* |  |  |
| \*Sound of the girl leaving the building\* |  |  |
| \*ladybug whining for a few seconds\* |  |  |
| \[Dee\] Hey\! I uh... god *damnit*.  |  |  |
|  |  | \[Graves\] Hey. Dee. |
|  |  | \[Dee\] \*typing\* hey cowboy. |
|  |  | \[Graves\] There ain't nothing here. |
|  |  | \[Dee\] One... sec... I'mma verify. |
| The sound of Dee and Graves' conversation grows faint, but Ladybug remains clearly audible. You can hear her sniffing as she seemingly moves away from Dee. |  |  |
|  |  | \[Graves\] Yup. Nothing. |
|  |  | \[Dee\] Hmm. |
|  |  | \[Graves\] Who's the fart that called this in? |
|  |  | \[Dee\] You want his number? |
|  |  | \[Graves\] Yeah, send the number. |
| Ladybug whines and sniffs more. The conversation between Dee and Graves is now completely inaudible. |  |  |
| (\~8min) Something that sounds like a faint, low-pitch version of the anomaly sound plays, as if slightly distant.. |  |  |
| There's a rattling sound, like wind blowing junk around. |  |  |
