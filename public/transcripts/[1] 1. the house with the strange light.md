The field was nothing like I'd seen before. It was gold,  how the sun lit the wheat.  I had to shield my eyes. That's how I found it.  Just lying there in the dirt by my feet.  Would have missed it otherwise.  An old cassette tape.  I'd seen these in my uncle's old home before he vanished. We sold all his belongings, gave away the rest we couldn't sell.

00:45  
all his discarded parts of him to little pawn shops, Goodwills,  beach antique malls.  Sometimes when I go to one, I look through those shoeboxes of old black and white photographs, people I never met.  And I wonder if I have met them. Sometimes I look through the photos of strangers hoping I'll recognize a face. Sometimes I swear I do.  Sometimes.

01:12  
I think I'll come across one of my uncle's old cassette tapes. He labeled them the same. String of numbers,  the month, the date, the year.  Same as this tape I found in the dirt.  Looks just like one of his.  Can't be though.  Not all the way out here.

01:40  
dark now.  The gold is gone and the coyotes are talking.  I could stare at these clouds for hours expecting something to happen, just burning time.  I don't get scared much.

01:56  
My little brother had always begged me to stay close,  not leave him alone.  If he hadn't vanished either, he'd probably be sitting back in the car waiting for me.

02:08  
Not even sure why I parked.

02:13  
Mama would say I should have bought a coat.  And that's why my posture's dog shit.  Always hunched over to keep warm.  She hated repeating herself, so eventually she just didn't anymore.

02:27  
I miss her too.

02:32  
It's getting late. The coyotes are too quiet.

02:38  
Where the fuck did I park?

02:44  
I barely feel my hands.

02:51  
Light up ahead is something strange.  House, maybe.

02:59  
I still can't see my car, not anywhere.

03:04  
Stars are up though.  That's nice.  I don't get stars like this in this city.

03:12  
Last time I was out this far, the whole family was together.  Dad was teaching me how to make a fire.  My uncle made a good one though.  Said the TV shape isn't good for fires. Said the log cabin shape will last you all night. And dad got quiet. That meant he was embarrassed.

03:41  
Yeah, that's the house alright. Kitchen light on. Beat up old truck. I can hear my little bro's voice right now. Oh don't do it, don't do it. Don't knock on that door, please. Can't we just keep walking?

03:58  
He hated meeting new people.  Even if they'd save his life when he needed it, he'd rather just suffer.

04:13  
Hello?

04:16  
Someone here?

04:20  
Hello?

04:25  
um your door it's uh

04:31  
So I'm it's unlocked.

04:36  
Hello?

04:40  
There's half a log still burning.

04:46  
Nice library.

04:59  
an actual tape player.

05:02  
Hmm.

05:07  
All  right.
