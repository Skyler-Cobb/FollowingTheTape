| 00:00:00 | | | **[Gut Pill Ad]** “Neural gut risk, blend duration. Ask your doctor today. Morning. Do not take if you haven't slept for less than 10 hours. That's right.” |

| 00:00:34 | | | **[Gut Pill Ad]** “Not suitable for children or adults over the age of—” |
| 00:00:37 | | **[Mom]** “Turkey?” | |
| 00:00:38 | | **[Man]** “Uh, no meat.” | |
| 00:00:39 | | | **[Game Show Host]** “Woo! Who’s ready to spin the wheel?” |
| 00:00:44 | | **[Mom]** “What if I just made you a grilled cheese?” | |
| 00:00:46 | | **[Man]** “Sure.” | |
| 00:00:49 | | | **[Game Show Host]** “That’s right!” |
| 00:00:50 | | **[Mom]** “You feeling okay?” | |
| 00:00:51 | | | **[Game Show Host]** “Come on down!” |
| 00:00:53 | | **[Mom]** “Your dad said he'll be home tomorrow night. It’s just a last-minute job.” | |
| 00:00:58 | | | **[Game Show Host]** “Alright, Doris, come on down—Doris!” |
| 00:01:05 | | | **[Game Show Host]** “Alright, Doris.” |
| 00:01:07 | | | **[Doris (Game Show Contestant)]** “Uh, well, I'm here for my son. We haven’t seen each other the whole time.” |
| 00:01:11 | | | **[Game Show Host]** “Oh, well that’s—” |
| 00:01:13 | | | **[Game Show Host]** “Beautiful. Oh my.” |
| 00:01:19 | | | **[Doris (Game Show Contestant)]** “For you. Mommy’s gonna win big!” |
| 00:01:27 | | | **[Game Show Host]** “Now come on over and give the wheel a spin!” |
| 00:01:27 | | | **[Doris (Game Show Contestant)]** “Me, baby. I’m so nervous.” |
| 00:01:30 | | | **[Game Show Host]** “Oh, don’t be nervous, girl. Give it a good grab ‘n’ go!” |
| 00:01:36 | | | **[Doris (Game Show Contestant)]** “Oh, a good one. Oh—” |
| 00:01:46 | **[Narrator]** “As he watched his favorite game show, he found himself periodically staring out the window instead, remembering in grade school how he’d learned the water cycle. The three ­ations, they called them: precipitation, evaporation… He struggled on the third. The harder he thought about it, the further it slipped away.” | | |
| 00:02:16 | **[Narrator]** “Just a word, and suddenly he couldn’t think of it—what exactly did occur above the clouds, what was happening up there? Something he understood, but had never seen firsthand. His dad would tell him that every great astronomer suffered their dedication, being holy through a single sense—and that was sight.” | | |
| 00:02:51 | **[Narrator]** “They could see so much of everything they postured on, but never hear it. Never touch it. Even what they saw was limited.” | | |
| 00:03:05 | **[Narrator]** “As he flitted between the TV and the window and the rain outside, he felt it—he could feel me watching him.” | | |
| 00:03:19 | | | **[Doris (Game Show Contestant)]** “Is that good?” |
| 00:03:21 | | | **[Game Show Host]** “Huh? Well, I don't know! I’ve never had that actually happen before.” |
| 00:03:24 | | | **[Doris (Game Show Contestant)]** “I guess I should … spin again?” |
| 00:03:28 | | | **[Game Show Host]** “We’ll be right back after this commercial break!” |
| 00:03:31 | | **[Mom]** “Mind turning on the news?” | |
| 00:03:33 | | **[Man]** “Sure. One sec.” | |
| 00:03:36 | | **[Mom]** “You heard about that new invasive tree they found? You could watch it with me—learn all about it. You never know what you don’t know about trees, you know?” | |
| 00:03:48 | | **[Man]** “Uh, yeah, just a sec.” | |
| 00:03:49 | | | **[Cooking Show Host]** “It’s time to *chop!* This week we’re down to four contestants—four vegetables—one knife.” |
| 00:03:57 | | | **[Cooking Show Contestants]** “Why does *she* get a pepper? This is a watermelon! What am I supposed to—where’s the cutting board? I wanna go home!” |
| 00:04:02 | | | **[Cooking Show Contestants]** “Is the timer going? Uh—ow!” |
| 00:04:05 | | | **[Cooking Show Host]** “Who will survive tomorrow night before brushes with (indistinct)?” |

| 00:04:15 | | | **[Magic Man (TV Host)]** “One week only—the clock will be ticking—one hundred cadavers, a mile deep. One of them has one million dollars stashed inside their ribcage or skull— that’s for me to find out, all while breathing through this little tube. Will I make it? This could be my final trick … to the death!” |
| 00:04:42 | | | **[Reaching Spaces Ad]** “You are dialing in, but you aren’t in control. You’re just the variable, the capacitor, the diode—riding those frequencies a hundred miles an hour down the open highway. Where you’re going—that’s not up to you. Your life begins *now.* Find out more at Reaching Spaces. We’re listening.” |
| 00:05:18 | | | **[Mr. Pickles (Ad)]** “Hey, have I got a deal for you? Where is it? Hey—oh, hey! Hey! Have I got a deal for you? I think I do. Tired of getting nowhere? My God, girlfriend, I feel good! Premium triple-A brine—this ain’t your granddad’s brine…” |
| 00:05:44 | | | **[Mr. Pickles (Ad)]** “…None of that ‘we don’t use cucumbers’ overpriced hootenanny. *(Highly sped-up speech)* It’s healthy! Screw the origin-story, feeder-pals, and get in your feeder pens and cut the crap! My brine is twice as nice for half the price—I’m practically giving it away!” |
| 00:06:04 | | | **[Mr. Pickles (Ad)]** “You know me—I’m a personal-deal guy. Give me a call—just give me a call—*please* call me! Your deal is running out the door—it’s outta here, it’s going—whoa, it’s going right, it’s—” |
| 00:06:21 | | | **[Mr. Pickles (Ad)]** “Oh, I’m back.” |

| 00:06:33 | | **[Mom]** “Hon?” | |
| 00:06:33 | | | **[Mr. Pickles (Ad)]** “That’s how—” |
| 00:06:33 | | **[Mom]** “That report should be coming on soon.” | |
| 00:06:35 | | | **[Mr. Pickles (Ad)]** “—up!” |
| 00:06:35 | | | **[Mr. Pickles (Ad)]** “And it’s running out!” |
| 00:06:36 | | **[Man]** “Wait, what?” | |
| 00:06:38 | | **[Mom]** “It’s already started, I think.” | |
| 00:06:39 | | | **[Mr. Pickles (Ad)]** “You’ll like it—” |
| 00:06:40 | | **[Man]** “Wait a minute—what? What time is it? *What time is it?*” | |

| 00:06:44 | | **[Man]** “Oh—oh my God. I gotta go.” | |
| 00:06:46 | | | **[Mr. Pickles (Ad)]** “—freeze it and lick it!” |

| 00:06:50 | | | **[Mr. Pickles (Ad)]** “Delicious!” |
| 00:06:51 | | **[Man]** “Yeah, whatever. Whatever.” | |
| 00:06:51 | | | **[Mr. Pickles (Ad)]** “Put a little fish in there and they don’t freeze it!” |
| 00:06:53 | | **[Mom]** “What even *is* this crap?” | |

| 00:07:05 | | | **[Documentary]** “Green and glorious, known for its overwhelming predation among resident plant life, the *mother brain* will spread rapidly, draining nearby plants of their nutrients, sucking the soil dry…” |
| 00:07:37 | | | **[Documentary]** “…Her seeds carried by birds and smaller flightless mammals… this tasty treat has become—oh shit.” |
| 00:08:00 | | | **[Documentary]** “Locals and environmental advocacy are—some see the mother brain to be far too invasive, impossible to tame… as you’ll now witness, time-lapsed over a mere three months…” |
| 00:08:30 | | | **[Documentary]** “(indistinct) The brushing porch.” |
| 00:08:33 | | | **[???:]** “First time you heard it here.” |
| 00:08:36 | | **[Mom]** “It’s a little burnt, but I managed to save it.” | |
| 00:08:41 | | **[Mom]** “Okay. Well, it’ll be right there when you’re ready—don’t let it get too cold.” | |

| 00:08:55 | | | **[Midnight Riddle-Master]** “Riddlers… you hold onto me, yet never reach me. You have met me, and not remembered me. You will see me, but never hear me. You must escape me, but not for long.” |
| 00:09:29 | | | **[Midnight Riddle-Master]** “Once more for the sleepy ones.” |

| 00:09:42 | | **[Man]** “Hmm…” | |
| 00:09:44 | | | **[Midnight Riddle-Master]** “You have met me and not remembered me.” |

| 00:10:01 | | **[Man]** “Oh—oh shit! What the fuck was that? What was that? What the fuck happened? Oh—what happened? What’s going on up there?” | |
| 00:10:18 | | **[Mom]** “I’m okay. I—I just think I might need some help getting up.” | |
| 00:10:24 | | **[Man]** “I can't see up the fucking stairs. Where’s the flashlight?” | |
| 00:10:30 | | **[Mom]** “The hand-crank one should be down there.” | |
| 00:10:33 | | **[Man]** “Oh—yes, okay. Yes!” | |
| 00:10:35 | | **[Mom]** “Do you remember what it looks like?” | |
