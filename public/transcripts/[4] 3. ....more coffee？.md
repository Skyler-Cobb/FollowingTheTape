Narrator is at a diner, it seems.

“It was like weeks had passed, but it was all the same. Night strangers floated in and out, siphoned off the road in their metal capsules. Metal everywhere, metal chairs, metal tables, metal tools shoveling dead animals and scrambled miscarriages into their stomachs.”

At this point, the narrator’s thoughts are interrupted by a waitress asking if he’d like more coffee, stopping the monologue. At first, she sounds distant and a bit muffled, then clear and unobstructed. This seemingly confirms that the narrator is not speaking out loud, or possibly even purposefully narrating for us.

She offers him coffee, he accepts, sounding a bit shy. Then she offers a menu, which he turns down, saying coffee’s good.   
The waitress then goes and offers coffee to somebody else, a woman, who accepts, then also turns down a menu. She will be referred to in this document as \[Woman A\].

Narrator begins again. “The woman waiting for someone had been here as long as me. I recognized her... from somewhere. Or maybe I was here first. That’s right, I recognized her the moment she walked in and sat down at the counter. As she drank her coffee, I thought of asking her where... I knew her from... but...”

Interrupted by \[Waitress\] again. She asks if \[Narrator\] wants coffee, remembers he just got a refill, apologizes, and asks if he’s sure he doesn’t want any food. Says he looks like he needs it.

\[Narrator\] responds by saying that **his hands always shake like this.**

\[Waitress\] says he was here last night

\[Narrator\] says “I was?”

\[Waitress\] says “how about... toast, eggs, bacon?”

He gives in and says sure. She leaves.

Narration resumes. “Or maybe it was her. But the woman at the counter drinking her coffee alone looked like someone out of a photograph. The more I looked at her, the more it made my head hurt.”

Narration breaks again, this time with the other woman’s voice.

\[Woman A\] “Is that guy staring at me?”“Is that guy staring at me?”

\[Woman B\] I don’t think so, is that the guy you’re waiting for? 

\[Woman A\] I feel like he’s staring at me. 

\[Waitress\] Who you talking about? 

\[Woman A\] That guy. 

\[Waitress\] Oh.

\[Woman B\] Trucker? 

\[Waitress\] I didn’t see him pull up.

\[Woman B?\] Homeless?

\[Waitress\] Might be an out-of-townie.

\[Woman A\] Mmm. I could see that.

\[Waitress\] He came in a while ago. I don’t know, just... sitting over there.

\[Woman A\] Should we... call someone?

\[Woman B\] Who?

At this point, the door chimes, as somebody walks in. 

\[Paul\] Holy fucking-

\[Woman A\] I dunno.

\[Paul\] \-shit\!

\[Waitress\] Hey paul.

\[Paul\] Do you see it hailing?\!

\[Waitress\] Yeah, we hear it.

\[Paul\] Christ, thank God I’m fucking out of that shit.

\*Sound of coffee being poured\*

\[Woman... B?\] I gotta step out. You got a match?

\[Waitress\] I have *a* match.

\[Woman B\] \*quietly\* fuck...

\[Waitress\] Good luck.

\[Paul\] You do *not* want to go out there, trust me.

\[Waitress\] \*sighs\* Just use my office.

\[Woman B\] 

\[Waitress\] Yeah, just crack a window.

Sounds of a match being lit.

\[Woman B\] Please, god, please...

Sounds of a match coming to life. Woman B sighs deeply, then inhales deeply. There are the pounds of breathing for a bit.  
The sound of a TV or radio coming to life is audible. It’s mostly fuzzy, with inaudible words and intermittent music.

\[Man 1 on Channel 1\] So you, ah... here for some \[dealings?\], right?

\[B\] Like another you out there?

\[G\] Or another you.

\[G\] Oh my god that’s so fucking cheesy.

\[B\] Well...

\[B\] It’s true\! I’m the whatever.

\[G\] That’s not true.

\[B\] I’m being serious

\[G\] I know, I know... you’re really nice. Maybe not the... thinker, like me, but you’re nice.

\[G\] Oh \*shit\*, do you see that?

\*sound of a door opening IRL\*

\[G\] Holy *shit*.

\[G\] Uh, yeah, a little.

\[B\] Here.

\[G\] Oh, thanks... you know, you were in my dream last night.

\[B\] ...I was?

\[G\] Yeah.

\[B\] What was I doing?

\[G\] I dunno, just, like... walking.

\[B\] Uh, like... together?

\[G\] No, not you *and* me, just you. You were in a field, talking to yourself.

\[B\] What did I say?

\[G\] Uh... hmmm... I don't...

\[B\] Was it a good dream?

\[G\] I think so. It was peaceful.It was... it was peaceful. You were just, like, walking. It was gold out. Like, sunny, but it was late. Not, like, sunset, but... y'know. Real movie shit.

\[B\] Uh... did we like...?

\[G\] I don't think I was there.

\[B\] Oh.

\[G\] Or I was just like... floating, next to you.

\[B\] Like a ghost?

\[G\] With you, maybe?

\[B\] Huh.

**AT THIS POINT, THE SNOW IN THE VIDEO REVERSES DIRECTION**

\[B\] I like floating with you.

\[G\] Yeah........... where's that light coming from?

**AT THIS POINT, THE SCREEN STARTS ARTIFACTING AND GLITCHING**

**The noises of something are audible, but it's not clear what.**

**Video Ends.**
