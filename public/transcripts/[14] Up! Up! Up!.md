| 00:00:00  | **\[Child B]** Have you ever heard a, wait, I don't know how to pronounce that.                                                                                                |
| 00:00:06  | **\[Child A]** Is this gonna be on tv?                                                                                                                                         |
| 00:00:10  | **\[Child B]** Hello? Hi.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 00:00:14  | **\[Child A]** The, there's somebody staring at me over there.                                                                                                                 |
| 00:00:18  | **\[Child B]** If you want to be like me, you should read the Up, up, up by Cathy Birdio.                                                                                      |
| 00:00:25  | **\[Child B]** Ver-dee-go. Oh, sorry. By Cathy Verdigo.                                                                                                                        |
| 00:00:31  | **\[Child A]** I really like the the rabbit, the Jack Rabbit telling the story, and I like how he talks about the coyotes and where they go.                                   |
| 00:00:42  | (Indistinct low voice mumbles in background)                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:00:42  | **\[Child A]** I feel bad for the coyote Jack, though. He really tried hard.                                                                                                   |
| 00:00:47  | **\[Child B]** In this story. One day there was a b-boy who liked his parents and never cried on the weekends. Then his dad went away, but not to work.                        |
| 00:00:56  | **\[Child A]** I think the coyotes go to the up, up, up, because like I think they have... to, and it's sad, but like they don't have to be coyotes anymore.                   |
| 00:01:09  | **\[Child B]** His mom tells him, his dad went to the Up, up, up, which is a place between places. So then after that, the boy sets off on a magical and adventure to find it. |
| 00:01:21  | **\[Child A]** My dad wasn't a coyote, but he would probably think. It would be pretty fun. Or, or maybe he would get to be one now and be friends with the, with Coyote Jack. |
| 00:01:35  | **\[Child B]** Along the way he meets some pretty funny creatures that do some silly things, but there's one, uh, that made me sad, so I ripped the page out.                  |
| 00:01:46  | **\[Child A]** The up, up up is like, it's kind of like being alive and so we don't have to be sad about... things as much as- I like that.                                    |
| 00:01:57  | **\[Child B]** My favorite book, uh, by far is called The Up, up, up by Cathy Verdigo.                                                                                         |
| 00:02:04  | **\[Child B]** It changed my life.                                                                                                                                             |
| 00:02:06  | **\[Child A]** I think it, I think it was cool when the narrator was to- torn into little pieces, but he was okay with it, and that made me laugh.                             |
| 00:02:16  | **\[Child B]** It, it kind of like it, it's kind of like. It looks like upside down.                                                                                           |
| 00:02:21  | **\[Child A]** My friend Joshua P told me that I can't tell anybody how we got the book.                                                                                       |
| 00:02:27  | **\[Child B]** Kind of makes me feel like the rabbit, like around certain people, he tries to act innocent, but like, he's actually not innocent.                              |
| 00:02:38  | **\[Child A]** The bunny is staring at me. It's, it's kind of scary.                                                                                                           |
| 00:02:41  | **\[Child B]** Like. It just looks scary that like a rabbit would be standing up. It kind of looks like a human. It looks kind of scary.                                       |
| 00:02:48  | **\[Child A]** One time I went into the park and I got really, really lost, but I met this squirrel and he taught me... me a lot.                                              |
| 00:03:00  | **\[Child A]** Or maybe that was my brother.                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:03:02  | **\[Child B]** I have no regrets. I have three best friends named Mike and I get to eat lu-lunch at circle tables.                                                             |
| 00:03:09  | **\[Child A]** When I'm having a bad day. I like to go outside and just listen. I like the book because it has those things in it, which really calms me down. Kind of.        |
| 00:03:20  | **\[Child B]** By the way, this isn't the first book I've read, so my opinion matters.                                                                                         |
| 00:03:24  | **\[Child A]** I just think it's nice to think about and. But probably my funniest book this year so far.                                                                      |
| 00:03:32  | **\[Child B]** Next time Feeder Fair comes to your school, don't, uh, buy spy wat-watches. Buy Up, up, up by Cathy Verdigo. It is an instant classic.                          |
| 00:03:44  | **\[Child A]** I give this book four thumbs. Up, up, up.                                                                                                                       |
| 00:03:48  | **\[Child B]** Now I'm a carrot soup kid. Thank you Arachnid Antelope.                                                                                                         |
| 00:03:53  | **\[Child A]** Thank you arachti an- thank you Arachnid Antelope!                                                                                                              |
| 00:03:58  | **\[Child B]** I think it's just like the right type for me. It's pretty funny and sometimes scary in it.                                                                      |
| 00:04:04  | **\[Child A]** Am I a carrot soup kid now?                                                                                                                                     |
