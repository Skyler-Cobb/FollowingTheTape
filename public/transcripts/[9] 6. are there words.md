*Note: While Zoe's name could be explicitly confirmed via the dialogue in this video, the fact that the other person is Dee isn't quite as well supported. The other girl and dee sound extremely alike, though, and various details seem to indicate that they're the same person, so I've chosen to label her as such.*
